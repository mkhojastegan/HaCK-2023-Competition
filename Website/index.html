    <h1>Welcome to Team J.Y.M.'s Gauntlet Prototype</h1>
      <p>Due to a devastating earthquake that struck through the UCLA Campus, Bruin engineers became trapped in Boelter Hall and needed urgent help. So, we assembled a gauntlet protoype designed with the essential properties to be able to nagivate through the ruins of Boelter Hall and rescue the trapped Bruin Engineers.
