# HaCK 2023 Compeition
This repository includes the website and Arduino project for the 2023 HaCK compeition in which my team developed a physical gauntlet with multiple sensors to save Bruin engineers from a burning building.

All physical and structural tests were passed, and the website is fully functional, including information on live data, our process, and team structure.

# Building
### Arduino
The Arduino project is compatible with Arduino IDE 2.2.1 and newer. Ensure you have the following compatible sensors and items:
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor
- OLED screen
- Wi-Fi compatability (built-in Arduino function)

Modify circuit pins and Wi-Fi settings as needed in the project file.

### Website
Building either can be done with live-server automatically, or with the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
